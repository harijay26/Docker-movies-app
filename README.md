# MERN Docker Compose Application(movies-app)

# Introduction

For this project, I decided to use the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) technology to build a CRUD App. I then containerized the api server and react client and created docker-compose to connect them.

- Run "make build" from root to build containers Run "make run" from root to run containers with docker-compose
